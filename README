A collection of classes for various regression analysis models

What makes these regression classes interesting is that they perform gradient descent and all other statistical calculations explicitly without the use of outside packages. Features like the negative hessian matrix are left exposed so that one might better understand what's going on "under the hood" of these regression techniques.

This collection is ongoing and so far includes:
-Logistic Regression
-Binomial Regression
