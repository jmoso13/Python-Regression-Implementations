A collection of python implementations of regression analysis techniques

Written by: Jeff Sontag as supplemental to class research

These classes are written from scratch, implement gradient descent, as well as provide access to the underpinnings inherent in these regression techniques. Structures like the negative hessian matrix used to compute standard error across variable coefficients are laid bare for the user to explore and manipulate. 

DEPENDENCIES:
Numpy
Pandas (For Display)

This collection is ongoing and thus far includes:
-Logistic Regression
-Binomial Regression
